# Auction
This Solidity contract represents an auction system, where users can create auctions and bid on them

struct Bid {

- This line defines a new struct (a custom data type) named Bid.
- A Bid struct contains two fields:
    - address bidder; - the Ethereum address of the bidder.
    - uint amount; - the bid amount (in wei).

1. struct AuctionItem {

- This line defines a new struct named AuctionItem.
- An AuctionItem struct contains several fields:
    - string name; - the name of the auction item.
    - uint startPrice; - the starting price of the auction.
    - uint minIncrement; - the minimum increment required for new bids.(if the current highest bid is 10eth the minIncrement is 1eth a new bid is 11 because it's greater than 10+ 1)
    - uint auctionEndTime; - the timestamp when the auction ends.
    - mapping (uint => Bid) bids; - a mapping of bid IDs to Bid structs.
    - address highestBidder; - the Ethereum address of the highest bidder.
    - uint highestBid; - the amount of the highest bid.
    - bool ended; - a flag indicating whether the auction has ended.
    - uint bidCount; - the number of bids received.

2. mapping (uint => AuctionItem) public auctionItems;

- This line defines a public mapping named auctionItems that maps auction IDs (uint) to AuctionItem structs.

3. uint public nextAuctionId;

- This line defines a public variable named nextAuctionId to keep track of the next available auction ID.

4. function createAuction(string memory _name, uint _startPrice, uint _minIncrement, uint _auctionDuration) public {

- This line defines a public function named createAuction that creates a new auction.
- The function takes four parameters:
    - _name - the name of the auction item.
    - _startPrice - the starting price of the auction.
    - _minIncrement - the minimum increment required for new bids.
    - _auctionDuration - the duration of the auction (in seconds).

5. function bid(uint _auctionId) public payable {

- This line defines a public function named bid that allows users to place bids.
- The function takes one parameter:
    - _auctionId - the ID of the auction to bid on.
- The payable keyword indicates that this function can receive Ether.

6. function endAuction(uint _auctionId) public {

- This line defines a public function named endAuction that ends an auction.
- The function takes one parameter:
    - _auctionId - the ID of the auction to end.
